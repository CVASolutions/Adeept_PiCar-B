#Setup.py
The original setup file encountered many errors.  I re-ordered the deployment of the packages as well as added a prompt to allow users to select what they'd like to accomplish.

1 - Update OS
2 - Install Car
3 - Reboot
4 - Exit

These prompts were added as it was found that if a reboot wasn't executed upon after the update, it could cause errors.  It was also found that there were many inefficiencies in the code which led to errors.
